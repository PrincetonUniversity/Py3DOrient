# Py3DOrient

This code contains the python code that can be used to make the numerical simulation figures for the case of the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the division-of-amplitude polarimetry experiment. The example Jupyter notebook shows a simple case of what can be done, further experimentation may be scripted using the class functions in the CramerRaoFunctions.py file.
